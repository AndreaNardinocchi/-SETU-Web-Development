# -SETU-Web-Development
This is a website created to be submitted as a first Web Development assignment for SETU, Waterford, Ireland.
# CN Cinzia Nardinocchi | Psychology & Counseling
This website is about a Family Counselor based in Italy.
# What this project does 
Its purpose is simply to provide information about her profession in terms of its history and evolution in Italy, what a counselor practically does, the type of therapies, a blog, a short biography and also some contacts to get in touch.
# Why the project is useful
The project is useful for those users that would like to drill down a bit on the family counselor profession, as they can read up on it in the Homepage as well as on the Therapies page. Additionally, this project might be useful for users that think they might need to reach out to the family counselor herself too, as they may need to avail of her help and schedule some counseling sessions with Cinzia.
The ultimate idea here is to deliver a fully functional website to Cinzia, who currently does not have one, so that she can use it herself for her profession and to enable her to establish a meaningful and important presence online aimed also at helping her expand her business footprint.
# How users can get started with the project
As a user opens up the CN Cinzia Nardinocchi | Psychology & Counseling Homepage, they will see a sticky menu on the top for an easy navigation through the website and a hero image right below it (every page has a different hero image with a header h1):

As the user scrolls down, there will be some informative sections regarding Cinzia Nardinocchi and the family counselor profession overall, such as what a counselor is and why a user might want to avail of their services, as well as on mental health.
A CTA to know more about Cinzia is embedded in the article, which will land the user to the 'About me' page:
